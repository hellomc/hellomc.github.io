Finally! I was able to learn more about how to use Github and create a repository that is responsible for this site. I used [A Guide to Creating and Hosting a Personal Site on GitHub](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/). I learned some basics about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I am and will be using Markdown to author my posts.
